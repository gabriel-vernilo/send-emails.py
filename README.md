# send-emails.py
I developed this so that my classroom could receive e-mails from teachers and pass them on to each student individually

this python file search for destination emails in the list.txt, and send the same email to all

how to use :

this project use python3, make sure you have it installed

in email_list.txt put email recievers, one per line, after this, you replace "email_from", "email_from_pw" and "email_content" (following comments), save all, and run using "python3 emailsend.py"

in the terminal you should receive a success message,  in case it doesn't happen try check your email permissions in this link : https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and ACTIVATE this option 

now  you should have sucess to send the email.

example : i send a email from my test email (gabriel.vernilo) to my real email (bielvernilo). check result :
